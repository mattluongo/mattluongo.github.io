I am a CICOES Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Washington](https://environment.uw.edu/) advised by Professor [Kyle Armour](https://faculty.washington.edu/karmour/) and Dr. [Gregory Johnson](https://floats.pmel.noaa.gov/gregory-c-johnson-home-page). 
		
My goal as a large-scale climate dynamicist and physical oceanographer is to understand the ocean's role in driving past, present, and future climate variability and change through the lens of coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions. Check out my publications page for some recent studies.

I received my PhD as a NASA FINESST Fellow at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) advised by Professors [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) & [Ian Eisenman](https://ieisenman.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/). I graduated from Harvard University in 2017 with a joint degree in Earth & Planetary Sciences and Environmental Engineering and then worked as a utility consultant and a research assistant for a land trust before graduate school. In my free time you can find me exploring PNW natural spaces or catching live music.

Feel free to shoot me an email at mluongo(at)uw.edu.

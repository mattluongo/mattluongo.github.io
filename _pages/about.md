I'm a 3rd Year PhD student and NASA FINESST Fellow at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) advised by Professors [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) & [Ian Eisenman](https://eisenman.ucsd.edu/). 
		
I study large-scale climate dynamics with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic energy transport and coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Check out my research page for details on recent studies.

I graduated from Harvard in 2017 with a joint degree in Earth & Planetary Sciences and Environmental Engineering. Before graduate school, I spent two years working as both a utility consultant and a research assistant for a land trust. In my free time you can find me exploring California's natural spaces or catching live music.

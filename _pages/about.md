I am a CICOES Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Washington](https://environment.uw.edu/) and [NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/) advised by Professor [Kyle Armour](https://faculty.washington.edu/karmour/) and Dr. [Gregory Johnson](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/scientist/dr-gregory-c-johnson). I completed my PhD as a NASA FINESST Fellow at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) advised by Professors [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) & [Ian Eisenman](https://ieisenman.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/). 
		
I study large-scale climate dynamics through the lens of physical oceanography with a particular emphasis on coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions and energy transport. Check out my publications page for some recent studies.

I graduated from Harvard University in 2017 with a joint degree in Earth & Planetary Sciences and Environmental Engineering. Before graduate school, I worked as a utility consultant and then as a research assistant for a land trust. In my free time you can find me enjoying and exploring PNW natural spaces or catching live music.

Feel free to shoot me an email at mluongo(at)uw.edu.

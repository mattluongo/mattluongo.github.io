I'm a 3rd Year PhD student at <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> advised by Professors <a href="https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/">Shang-Ping Xie</a> & <a href="eisenman.ucsd.edu/">Ian Eisenman</a>. 
		
I study large-scale climate dynamics with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic energy transport and coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Check out my research page for details on recent studies.

I graduated from Harvard in 2017 with a joint degree in Earth & Planetary Sciences and Environmental Engineering. Before graduate school, I spent two years working as both a utility consultant and a research assistant for a land trust. In my free time you can find me exploring California's natural spaces or catching live music.
